# Hardware widgets

These are examples of hardware designs for testing Verilator backend integration to TVM

## Requirements

This repository is meant to be used together with TVM (3rdparty folder) and not standalone,
because it depends on certain headers (device and runtime) available in TVM.

Install Verilator (4.100 or above)

## Build

Build scalar add hardware by running `make`
